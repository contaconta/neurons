## Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ##

CVLAB actively collaborate with a group of neuroscientists in an effort to better understand how the brain develops and functions. Today, neuroscientists employ many types of microscopy techniques in their research, ranging from simple brightfield and confocal microscopes to more advanced phase contrast techniques to state-of-the-art 2-photon and scanning electron microscopes. While every microscopy technique has certain advantages to suit its purpose, they all share a common drawback: The massive amounts of data produced cannot be individually analyzed by humans. CVLAB researchers are working with neuroscientists to develop techniques to automatically process this data, allowing neuroscientists to conduct experiments and analyze data at scales that were previously not possible.

Our research focuses of four tasks:
  1. Detecting neurons (and components of neurons) in microscopic data, such as nuclei, mitochondria, and synapses;
  1. Segmenting neuron structures from the background;
  1. Reconstructing the structure of neurons such as neurites or the dendritic tree;
  1. Tracking the paths of migrating neurons as they travel in time-lapse microscopy.
