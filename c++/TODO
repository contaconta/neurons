German :

- Cube:: Check indexToMicrometers and micrometersToIndexes for the X,Y,Z offsets do it in a matrix form

- Cube: trilinear interpolation in the cube - sample method

- Viewer:: do all the things that are in the TODO

- Clone the objects (points, graphs, clouds, etc....)

- load tiffs with color as an option

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aurelien :

- Graphcut should be implemented as a plug-in

- Plugin for steerable filters in 2d
Questions :
* When selecting region, should we create a new Image ?
* should we pass an image, cube or a filename to SteerableFilter2DMultiScale ?

- bug in get_files_in_dir ?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everybody :

- In Cloud::Load, load allocates a p at the end of the while loop that is unused
- Al : Do we need to keep a list of open modules ? should be discussed...
