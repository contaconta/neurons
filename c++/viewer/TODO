There are many things to do on the viewer:

- Split visualization and data containers
- Make a list of objects that are on the display list
- For each visualization, make a property editor
   -- control how the different objects control the rendering
      technique
   -- plus the per-object properties
- Make a clear distinction between modes
   -- ascEditor
   -- viewer
   -- cloudEditor
- Make some help to recall the keyboard shortcuts
- Extend for time

- Make video tools for fast implementation
- Image operations controled from the interface (threshold, mask, ...)
