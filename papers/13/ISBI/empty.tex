Our approach   is  capable  of  robustly   detecting,  tracking,  and
segmenting components of each neuron present in the sequence including
the nucleus,  soma, neurites,  and filopoida.  While  previous efforts
have tracked the soma and nucleus,  our approach is the first to track
and reconstruct the neurites as  they expand, branch and collapse, and
to dynamically detect fine filopodia structures.  In order to meet the
demands required  for high-throughput siRNA screens,  our framework is
designed to  be extremely  efficient -- processing  a single  image in
approximately one second.
