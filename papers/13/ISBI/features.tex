\vspace{-3mm} Our  tracking and  segmentation method produces  sets of
graphs linking  detections, contours, and trees to  define each neuron
over  time.  This  data   structure  is  not  immediately  useful  for
quantifying dynamic behaviors.  To facilitate the analysis, we extract
a  set of {\em  156 meaningful  features} from  our data  structure to
quantify morphodynamics, which  are too numerous to list  here.  A few
examples  for   the  nucleus   and  soma  include:   area,  perimeter,
Lifeact-GFP  intensity,  NLS-mCherry  intensity, speed,  acceleration,
total distance  traveled, time spent  expanding/contracting, frequency
of expansion.  For neurites: number  of branches, distance from tip to
soma, filopodia  length, number of  filopodia, major axis,  minor axis
and eccentricity of an ellipse fitted to the neurite, total length, time
spent expanding/contracting, frequency of expansion (and
$\Delta$'s for all above).
