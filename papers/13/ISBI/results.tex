\noindent  {\bf Experimental  Setup and  Methodology --}  We  used our
method to perform a small-scale siRNA screen in which the functions of
5  genes were inhibited  with three  goals in  mind: to  reproduce the
findings of~\cite{Pertz08}, to confirm previous qualitatively observed
morphodynamics, and  to uncover  new dynamic behaviors.   Three siRNAs
were applied for each gene  (SrGAP2, MAP2K7, RhoA, Trio, and Net), for
a  total  of 17  experiments  including  2  controls.  30  videos  per
experiment were obtained over the  course of 3 days, with images taken
in  10 minute intervals  for a  total of  510 videos,  each containing
approximately 100 2-channel images  of $696 \times 520$ resolution.  A
total of 7,298 neurons and 33,213 neurites were tracked and segmented.
Our method  processes a single video  in 210 seconds on  a Lenovo W510
notebook computer (2.1  seconds per image), and the  entire screen was
processed in parallel in just a few hours using conventional PCs.

%over the course  of 16 to 18 hours,

Our  quantitative  analysis  investigated  the effects  of  inhibiting
various gene  functions on each  of the 156 morphodynamic  features we
extracted     from    our     segmentations     as    described     in
Sec.~\ref{sec:features}.   We  summarize  our  findings below  and  in
Fig~\ref{fig:quantitative_analysis}. We also  provide a detailed table
and  video  results in  the  supplementary  material.  Throughout  the
pipeline, many potential sources of noise exist, including variability
in   neuron   behavior,   transfection   effects,  mistakes   in   our
segmentation, and  imaging conditions.  The sheer number  of cells and
neurites  analyzed  helps  to  average  out the  noise.  Our  findings
reported  below are statistically  significant, all  having $p$-values
$<< 0.05$.

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent {\bf Analysis --} Our analysis confirms the effects found through static image
analysis  in~\cite{Pertz08}.  In  particular,  RhoA  loss  of  function
resulted in fewer but longer neurites than the control. SrGap loss was
found to have longer neurites, and  Map2K7 loss was found to have
more neurites but with short length.  These findings  were confirmed by dynamic measures in
our experiments: the mean longest  neurite length -- control $22.6 \mu
m$, RhoA-3 $32  \mu m$, SrGap2-1 $28.9 \mu m$,  and Map2K7-1 $19.5 \mu
m$  (see  Fig.~\ref{fig:quantitative_analysis}a)$^1$;  and  by  a  dynamic
measure --  the mean  number of neurites  belonging a neuron  over its
lifetime: control 3.4, RhoA 3.1, and Map2K7-1 3.9.

It  was qualitatively  observed, but  never quantified,  that  loss of
SrGap2 function  produces a  high number of  filopodia, and  that RhoA
loss  results  in neurites  that  easily  extend  but have  difficulty
retracting. These morphodynamics were  confirmed by our analysis. Mean
number of filopodia detected per  neurite over its lifetime was $6.69$
in the control  and $8.81$ for SrGap-3$^1$. The  mean change in elongation
as measured  by an ellipse fitted  to the neurite was  $5.7\%$ for the
control        and        $5.3\%$        for        RhoA-1        (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:quantitative_analysis}b)$^1$. While this difference may seem
small,  it is  significant due  to the  large amount  of  data collected
($p$-value is $2 \times 10^{-7}$).

Our quantitative analysis revealed new morphodynamics which
were not obvious to human  observers. We found that RhoA function loss
slowed  neuron motility and  Map2K7 increased  it.  Control cells
moved at  .30 $\mu  m / min$,  RhoA moved  at .23 $\mu  m /  min$, and
Map2K7-2     moved     at    .37     $\mu     m     /    min$     (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:quantitative_analysis}c).  We  also found that  RhoA and
SrGap  increased the  branching of  the
neurites (see Fig.~\ref{fig:quantitative_analysis}d).  Over the course
of a  neurites lifetime, the maximum  number of branches  in a control
neuron    was    14.5,   19.44    for    RhoA-3,    and   21.39    for
SrGap2-3\footnote{Only neurons containing  the  $10^{th}$  percentile  of
  longest neurites were considered.}.

\noindent {\bf Conclusion  --} We have described a  set of algorithms
which, as a  system, are capable of robustly  tracking and segmenting entire
neurons  including  the nucleus,  soma,  neurites  and filopodia.  Our
approach is efficient, and  can analyze high-throughput datasets using
meaningful dynamic  features extracted from  our segmentations.
We  validated  our  approach  by  reproducing
previous findings,  confirming anecdotal findings,  and uncovering new
dynamic phenotypes. It is beyond the scope of this work to comment on
the biological significance of these findings, if there is any. We
leave that for future work.
