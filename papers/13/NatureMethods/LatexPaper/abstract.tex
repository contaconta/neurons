\begin{abstract}
Neurite outgrowth is a dynamic cell behavior that consists of morphogenetic processes such as neurite initiation, protrusion-retraction cycles, branching and growth cone navigation. Current knowledge of the underlying signaling events stem from molecular perturbations assessed at the steady state, which cannot capture the dynamic nature of this complex process. Here, we present NeuroDynamics an integrated pipeline to study neurite outgrowth dynamics. A microscopy platform allows for high content imaging of neurite outgrowth dynamics. A computer vision approach allows segmentation of cell shape and extraction of features describing neuronal morphodynamics. Statistical analysis then allows to automatically identify features that significantly discriminate between the control and perturbed state. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by automatically annotating morphodynamic phenotypes in an RNA interference screen targeting a candidate Rho GTPase signaling network identified by a proteomics approach. NeuroDynamics is freely available as open source software to study neuronal outgrowth dynamics.

\item You are welcome to add some technical jargon given that we remain in the 150 words limit !
\item  We can also think of another acronym than Neurodynamics !
