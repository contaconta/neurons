\maketitle

In this supplementary document, we describe and evaluate the computer vision pipeline that allowed to automatically segment and track the soma and neurites in each frame of the timelapse datasets.

%Our approach first detects nuclei and associated somata at each time step. The nucleus of each neuron is detected as a Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER)~\cite{Nister:2008} from the Cherry channel. Using the detected nuclei as seed points, a region-growing algorithm segments the neuron’s soma. Next, the implemented multi-objects tracking algorithm~\cite{BerclazTPAMI2011} searches through the full set of nuclei and somata detections to extract the best K-shortest paths according to a similarity measure between two detections. The proposed similarity measure is derived from the Earth Mover’s Distance~\cite{Pele-iccv2009} between the intensity histograms of the detected somata regions (in the supplementary note 3, we show that this distance provides a good tradeoff between efficiency and precision).  Neurons are detected and tracked at an accuracy of (TODO 95\%) (still waiting for the GT to be completed for number crunching); …Finally, the tracked somata are used to initialize a neurite segmentation and association algorithm based on shortest path computation and Voronoi tessellation. Comparison to manually annotated data demonstrates that …(URGENT TODO: crunch the numbers: still waiting for the GT)…

\section{Data description and ground truth}

\subsection{Input data description and notations}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The  input to  our approach  is a  series of  $T$ images  $\mathcal{I}  = \{I_1,
\ldots,  I_t,  \ldots, I_T\}$  from  which  we  extract $K$  nucleus  detections
$d_t^k$.   The  tracking step  described  in Sec.~\ref{sec:tracking}  associates
valid detections  across time steps  while rejecting spurious  detections. Since
each neuron  contains only  one nucleus, there  is a one-to-one  mapping between
each valid  nucleus detection $c_t^i$ and  a neuron $X_t^i$.  Thus, the tracking
task   is   to  provide   a   set   of   neuron  detections   $\mathcal{X}^i   =
\{X_{a}^i,\ldots,X_t^i,\ldots,X_{b}^i \}$ defining an individual neuron $i$ from
time  $t=a$  to $t=b$.   As  depicted  in  Fig.~\ref{fig:notation}, each  neuron
detection $X_t^i$ is composed of a nucleus $c_t^i$, a soma $s_t^i$, a set of $J$
neurites $\{n_t^{i,1},  \ldots, n_t^{i,j}, \ldots,  n_t^{i,J} \}$, and a  set of
$L$     filopodia    associated     with    each     neurite     $F_t^{i,j}    =
\{f_t^{i,j,1},\ldots,f_t^{i,j,l},\ldots,f_t^{i,j,L}  \}$ so  that  $N_t^i =  \{(
n_t^{i,1},F_t^{i,1}), \ldots,(n_t^{i,j},F_t^{i,j}) \}$.  Thus, a complete neuron
$i$  at time step $t$ is described by $X_t^i = \{ c_t^i, s_t^i, N_t^i \}$.

\subsection{Ground truth}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to evaluate our automatic algorithm, we manually annotated cell bodies and neurites using appropriate tools as described hereinafter.
We clearly distinguished between two annotation tasks: 
\begin{itemize}
\item segmentation and tracking of nuclei and somata from dynamic sequences,
\item segmentation of neurite trees from static images.
\end{itemize}
We clearly made this distinction because we could not find an appropriate semi-automatic or manual software for tracking the neurites. Therefore, even if our automatic pipeline is able to track neurites, only the quality of neurite trees at a given time frame will we assessed.

Our computer vision pipeline have been applied to two different sets of sequences acquired using two different magnifications: \texttt{10x} and \texttt{20x}. Therefore, we made random selections from each magnification set, and conducted our evaluation on each of them independently.
 
\subsubsection{Cell body ground truth}
To manually segment and track nuclei and somata from dynamic sequences, we used \texttt{TrakEM2}\footnote{publicly available at \url{http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2.html}}, a plugin of FIJI / ImageJ. To ease the annotation step, the input sequences have been encoded in a single multipage tiff file for each channel, and an xml file have been generated for each sequence to encode the segmentation and tracking data structure (see supplemental material).
\begin{itemize}
\item 12 sequences have been randomly selected from the \texttt{20x} dataset. From these sequences, 79 cells have been tracked, representing 4709 annotated nuclei and somata.
\item 3 sequences have been randomly selected from the \texttt{10x} dataset. From these sequences, 29 cells have been tracked, representing 2152 annotated nuclei and somata.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Neurite ground truth}
To segment neurite trees from static images, we used an improved version of the Simple Neurite Tracer (SNT) plugin. The SNT plugin\footnote{\url{http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Simple_Neurite_Tracer}}, a FIJI plugin, is a semi-automatic tool meant to reduce user' interaction for neuronal tree tracing . Recently, an improved version of SNT have been released \url{http://cvlab.epfl.ch/software/delin/index.php}, allowing a better description of the neurite branches, including their width estimate and more accurate centeline extraction as shown in figure~\ref{fig:annotations}.

Similarly to the dynamic dataset, we randomly selected images from the two different magnification sets, and annotated all visible neurite trees:
\begin{itemize}
\item 30 images from the 20x dataset have been randomly selected. 223 neurite trees or neurite branches have been annotated.
\item 27 images from the 10x dataset have been randomly selected. 257 neurite trees or neurite branches have been annotated.
\end{itemize}

Filopodia have been annotated only on images from the 20x dataset.

\section{Nuclei and somata segmentation}\label{sec:nuc}
%======================================================
\subsection{Nuclei Detection}
The  first  step in  our  approach  is to  extract  a  set of  nucleus
detections $\{d^1,\ldots,d^K\}$ over the  image series. We worked with
two-channel  images where the  cytoskeleton  is marked  with Lifeact-GFP and  nuclei   are   marked   with
NLS-mCherry. The nuclei can be reliably detected as a Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER)~\cite{Nister:2008} of the NLS-mCherry channel, and performing a morphological filling operation. The MSER detector finds regions that are stable over a wide range of thresholds of a gray-scale image. For that, we used the \texttt{VLFeat} implementation of MSER\footnote{publicly available at \url{http://www.vlfeat.org/}}. Default parameters of the MSER were used to segment the nuclei except the minimal and maximal size of a nuclei at the given resolution.  The main advantage of MSER compared to the thresholding approach \cite{Pertzs11} is its robustness and insensitivity to contrast variations.  

\subsection{Somata detection}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[!b]
  \begin{center}
       \begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{1mm}}c@{\hspace{1mm}}c@{\hspace{1mm}}c}

       \end{tabular} 
    \caption{ \footnotesize  Cell body detection. On the first row, nuclei detections overlaid on top of the NLS-mCherry channel. On the second row, somata detections overlaid on top of the Lifeact-GFP channel. From left to right: the original image, the manual annotations, and the automatic detections.}
    \label{fig:cellBDetection}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Using the nuclei as seed points, somata are segmented using a region growing and region competition algorithm on the Lifeact-GFP channel.
This is done by launching a propagating front from all the detected nuclei simultaneously. 
For a given image frame, let $\{d^1, \cdots, d^p \}$ be the set of detected nuclei.
To segment the semata, we first compute a solution of the Eikonal equation 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eikonal}
\|\nabla \mathcal{U} \| = \mathcal{P} \text{~~~~such that~~~~} \mathcal{U}(d^k) = 0,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potential}
\mathcal{P}(x) = \frac{1}{A \exp\left(- \frac{(I(x) - \mu_k)^2}{2 \beta^2 \sigma_k^2}\right) + 1},
\end{equation}
$k$ being the index of the closest nuclei detection $d_k$ to the pixel location $x$, and $I(x)$ being the associated green intensity, $\mu_k$ and $\sigma_k$ being the mean and standard deviation of the green intensities of pixels describung $d_k$.

$\mathcal{U}$ defines a distance to the detections $d^k$. It combines the local intensity differences and the euclidean distance. From equation \ref{eq:potential}, one can see that the more the green intensity of a pixel $I(x)$ is different from the mean intensity of the closest detected nuclei $\mu_k$, the higher the potential $\mathcal{P}$ would be, and from equation \ref{eq:eikonal}, the higher $\mathcal{U}$ would be. 

The somata segmentations are finally obtained by thresholding both $\mathcal{U}$ and the euclidean distance to the nuclei (those 2 shresholds are denoted $\mathcal{T}_g$ and $\mathcal{T}_e$ repectivelly). An example for nuclei and somata segmentation is depicted on figure \ref{fig:cellBDetection}. For all our experiments, we took $A = 1e7$, $\beta = 1.5$, $\mathcal{T}_g = 2e-6$ and $\mathcal{T}_e = 7$ for the 10x magnification and $
\mathcal{T}_e = 12$ for the 20x magnification.

\subsection{Evaluation}


A detection, either a nucleus or a somata, is considered positive if there exist a ground truth object (of the same kind) overlapping sufficiently with it.  More formally, a detection $d$ is considered as a positive detection if there exist a ground truth object $g$ such that $\displaystyle \frac{g\cap d}{g\cup d} > 80\%$.

\begin{itemize}
\item On the 10x dataset, and over the 3 annotated sequences, only 28 nuclei have not been detected. That represents {\bf{1.3\%}} of miss detections.
\item On the 20x dataset,  and over the 12 annotated sequences, 101 nuclei have not been detected. That represents {\bf{2.14\%}} of miss detections.
\end{itemize}

Since the ground truth is not complete, in other words, some visible cells have not been annotated, then we do not count the false positive detections.
