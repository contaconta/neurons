enumerateLearners should return indices
Matlab : storeWeakLearners should pass indices starting at 0
mexLoadResponse
    // TODO : this should be stored in matlab and passed as a parameter
    const int data_size = 10;

Deamon : run one instance only

Define learner type in a matlab file ?

responses = p_RectangleFeature(SET.IntImages, {learner});
=> How to pass image ?

How Adaboost should sample image for intensity feature ?
=> Extract images having the right size

memClient.cpp
=> int generateUniqueKey (look at ipcs source code in util-linux-2.12r)

Extract sub-images with a script :
/localhome/aurelien/Sources/MatLab/Image_Processing/Extract

p_request_data : param should be placed in p_settings ?
--------------------------

Kev: finish skeleton

Functions that need to be updated & checked:
p_cascade_select_threshold.m - needs to be updated with function to classify images.

Functions needed to be written:
* a function to classify examples: pass the images to the function and it will classify them


1st goal: get viola-jones working.

2nd goal: add rays

3rd goal: add more types of boosting

4th goal: add more features
