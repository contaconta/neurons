function RESPONSE = vj_fast_haar_response(f,II)
%VJ_FAST_HAAR_RESPONSE returns the haar feature response from and integral image
%
%   RESPONSE = vj_fast_haar_response(f,II) takes a row vector feature
%   'f' and a column vectorized integral image II (e.g. II = II(:)) and 
%   returns the haar-like feature response of the feature to integral image.  
%   The response is defined as the difference in intensity between dark and 
%   white regions.  Responses of multiple features can be computed by
%   adding rows to the feature vector.  Responses to multiple integral
%   images can be computed by adding columns to II.  Returns a row vector
%   of feature responses corresponding to each feature or integral image.
