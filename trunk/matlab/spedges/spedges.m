function A = spedges(I, angles, sigma)
%SPEDGES computes spedge features along ANGLES
%
%   FEATURES = spedges(I, ANGLE, SIGMA)  computes spedge features on a 
%   grayscale image I at angles defined by ANGLES (given as a vector, eg.
%   [0 90 180 270]).  FEATURES contains a stack of images, each
%   corresponding to an angle in ANGLES. Each pixel in FEATURES(i,:,:) 
%   contains the distance to the nearest edge in the direction of 
%   ANGLES(i).  Edges are computed using Laplacian of Gaussian 
%   zero-crossings (!!! in the future we may add more methods for 
%   generating edges).  SIGMA specifies the standard deviation of the edge 
%   filter.  
%
%   Example:
%   -------------------------
%   I = imread('cameraman.tif');
%   angles = 0:30:330;
%   SPEDGE = spedges(I,angles,2);
%   imagesc(SPEDGE(3,:,:));  axis image;
