Convenction on the statistics

f{f,n}NameStatistic.m

f = feature in the frames - we do not use the neuron information
n = feature associated with a neuron

Ex:

ffNeuriteLength.m
returns a vector with the length of all the neurites in the video

fnMeanNeuriteLength.m
returns a vector with the mean value of the neurite length of each neuron


They accept as input arguments the Run and a variable list of arguments.

The first argument is always LookOnlyAtHappyNeurons
