We present a fully automatic method to track and
quantify the morphodynamics of differentiating
neurons in fluorescence time-lapse datasets.
Previous high-throughput studies have been limited
to static analysis or simple behavior. Our
approach opens the door to rich dynamic analysis
of complex cellular behavior in high-throughput
time-lapse data. It is capable of robustly
detecting, tracking, and segmenting all the
components of the neuron including the nucleus,
soma, neurites, and filopodia. It was designed to
be efficient enough to handle the massive amount
of data from a high-throughput screen. Each image
is processed in approximately two seconds on a
notebook computer. To validate the approach, we
applied our method to over 500 neuronal
differentiation videos from a small-scale RNAi
screen. Our fully automated analysis of over 7,000
neurons quantifies and confirms with strong
statistical significance static and dynamic
behaviors that had been previously observed by
biologists, but never measured.

%Finally, we are first to analyze temporally the
%behavior of neurons, leading to findings not
%measurable through state-of-the-art static
%analysis. All our findings are statistically
%significant, with a p-value $\ll 0.05$.
