#summary Notes about work to be done on ProjectX.
#labels ProjectX

= Channels =
  * convert features so that they work as Channels
  * make sure haar features work for channels of different data types
  * strings -> 'C1_W1x32434blah'

= Mem Daemon =
  * make a matlab replacement for memdaemon for computers we cannot compile on
  * add a switch in settings to change between memdaemon and matlab equivelent

= C++ implementation of classification function =
  * we wrote feature_response, needs to be debugged/tested
  * we made changes to memdaemon:  getRow (changed name), getElement (added)
  * we need to write functions for: decision stumps, decision trees, strong classifier applied to a single example, strong classifier applied to many examples
  * eventually modify c++ to use data from matlab matrix when necessary

= Bootstrapping = 
  * bootstrapping for soft cascades can be complicated, need to worry about how and when to recollect data for training & validation
