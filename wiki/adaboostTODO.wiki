#summary A list of things to do for the adaboost project

= Generalization =
  * ada_train_weak_learners is not generalized properly (*ada_*_learn) are not interchangable yet
  * *make a LEARNER_DEFINITIONS structure* to contain all essential info about the weak learners and replace all the cells everywhere.  this should be defined in ada_train_settings

= Tidying Up =
  * rename ada_train_settings to ada_settings
  * ada_define_weak_classifiers needs to be cleaned a bit

= New Features = 
  * make logfile plot which type of feature was selected at each stage
